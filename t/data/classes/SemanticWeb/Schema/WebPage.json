The simplest use of <em>speakable</em> has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.<br/><br/>\n\n2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/cssSelector\">cssSelector</a> property.<br/><br/>\n\n3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/xpath\">xpath</a> property.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this\nwe define a supporting type, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification\">SpeakableSpecification</a>  which is defined to be a possible value of the <em>speakable</em> property.",

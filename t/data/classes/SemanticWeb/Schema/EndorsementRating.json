It can be considered the [[result]] of an [[EndorseAction]] in which the [[object]] of the action is rated positively by\nsome [[agent]]. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the [[Action]].\n\nAn [[EndorsementRating]] may be part of a numeric scale or organized system, but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,\nendorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.\n",

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=begin html

<p>A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information
update with contextualized Web links and other structured data. It
represents an information update made by a locally-oriented organization,
for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers, community groups,
police, local government.<br/><br/> For work in progress guidelines on
Coronavirus-related markup see <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3
IkB1lItlrM/edit#">this doc</a>.<br/><br/> The motivating scenario for
SpecialAnnouncement is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic">C
oronavirus pandemic</a>, and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this
urgent situation. Schema.org expect to improve the markup iteratively as it
is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our usual <a
href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490">Github entry</a>,
feedback comments can also be provided in <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_D
TtOQxMrBJQ/edit#">this document</a>.<br/><br/> While this schema is
designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the
same as an emergency warning technology like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol">CAP</a>,
although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover the kinds of
everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an
emergency situation.<br/><br/> Several kinds of information can be
provided:<br/><br/> We encourage the provision of "name", "text",
"datePosted", "expires" (if appropriate), "category" and "url" as a simple
baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category" where possible,
most ideally as a well known URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of
the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be
"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic"
or "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910".<br/><br/> For many of the
possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline
description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link,
provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For
an inline description, use a <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/WebContent">WebContent</a> type, and provide the
url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple "<a
class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/text">text</a>" summary of the
page. It is unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the
possible properties simultaneously.<br/><br/> We expect that in many cases
the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g.
contact info, <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/openingHours">openingHours</a>, <a
class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/Event">Event</a>, <a
class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/FAQPage">FAQPage</a> etc. By
linking to those pages from a <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a> you
can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g.
Coronavirus) indicated by the <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/category">category</a> property of the <a
class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a>.<br/><
br/> Many <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a>s will
relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use
<a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/spatialCoverage">spatialCoverage</a> for the
region, and <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/announcementLocation">announcementLocation</a> to
indicate specific <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/LocalBusiness">LocalBusiness</a>es and <a
class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/CivicStructures">CivicStructures</a>. If the
announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for
example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both <a
class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/spatialCoverage">spatialCoverage</a> and <a
class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/announcementLocation">announcementLocation</a>.<br/
><br/> The <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/about">about</a>
property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the
announcement. We now recommend using <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/about">about</a> only for representing non-location
entities (e.g. a <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/Course">Course</a> or a <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/RadioStation">RadioStation</a>). For places, use <a
class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/announcementLocation">announcementLocation</a> and
<a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/spatialCoverage">spatialCoverage</a>. Consumers of
this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of
/about for locations too.<br/><br/> The basic content of <a
class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a> is
similar to that of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)">Atom</a>
feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be
shared by posting <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a>
updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS
functionality, you can point to a feed with the <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/webFeed">webFeed</a> property. This can be a simple
URL, or an inline <a class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/DataFeed">DataFeed</a> object, with <a
class="localLink"
href="http://schema.org/encodingFormat">encodingFormat</a> providing media
type information e.g. "application/rss+xml" or "application/atom+xml".<p>

C<additionalProperty>

=begin html

A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the
entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there
is no matching property in schema.org.<br/><br/> Note: Publishers should be
aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties
(e.g. http://schema.org/width, http://schema.org/color,
http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be
provided using those properties, rather than using the generic
property/value mechanism.

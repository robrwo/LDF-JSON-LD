=head1 DESCRIPTION

=begin html

An action performed by a direct agent and indirect participants upon a
direct object. Optionally happens at a location with the help of an
inanimate instrument. The execution of the action may produce a result.
Specific action sub-type documentation specifies the exact expectation of
each argument/role.<br/><br/> See also <a
href="http://blog.schema.org/2014/04/announcing-schemaorg-actions.html">blo
g post</a> and <a href="http://schema.org/docs/actions.html">Actions

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 C<action_status>

C<actionStatus>

Indicates the current disposition of the Action.


A action_status should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::ActionStatusType']>

=back

=cut

has action_status => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => 1,
    json_ld   => 'actionStatus',
);


=head2 C<agent>



=begin html

The direct performer or driver of the action (animate or inanimate). e.g.
<em>John</em> wrote a book.

=end html


A agent should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Person']>

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Organization']>

=back

=cut

has agent => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => 1,
    json_ld   => 'agent',
);


=head2 C<end_time>

C<endTime>

=begin html

The endTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g.
FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to end. For
actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. e.g.
John wrote a book from January to <em>December</em>. For media, including
audio and video, it's the time offset of the end of a clip within a larger
file.<br/><br/> Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of
startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation
may be clarified in future revisions.

=end html


A end_time should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=cut

has end_time => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => 1,
    json_ld   => 'endTime',
);


=head2 C<error>



For failed actions, more information on the cause of the failure.


A error should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Thing']>

=back

=cut

has error => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => 1,
    json_ld   => 'error',
);


=head2 C<instrument>



=begin html

A instrument should be one of the following types:

A location should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Place']>

=head2 C<object>



=begin html

    predicate => 1,
    json_ld   => 'participant',

=head2 C<result>



=begin html

The result produced in the action. e.g. John wrote <em>a book</em>.

=end html


A result should be one of the following types:

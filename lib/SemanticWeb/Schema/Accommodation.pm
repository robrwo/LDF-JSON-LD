=begin html

An accommodation is a place that can accommodate human beings, e.g. a hotel
room, a camping pitch, or a meeting room. Many accommodations are for
overnight stays, but this is not a mandatory requirement. For more specific
types of accommodations not defined in schema.org, one can use
additionalType with external vocabularies. <br /><br /> See also the <a
href="/docs/hotels.html">dedicated document on the use of schema.org for
marking up hotels and other forms of accommodations</a>.
